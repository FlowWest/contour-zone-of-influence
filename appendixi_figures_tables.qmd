FlowWest was tasked with generating updated figures and tables for [Appendix I](https://www.usbr.gov/mp/nepa/includes/documentShow.php?Doc_ID=55301). The updated figures/tables
will only include the new Act5 and NAA (no action alternative). NAA has not changed
since the last version of Appendix I (from Adam Witt) so the results for that scenario
will be the same. 

This document compiles the figures/tables using code originally developed by [Catarina Pien](https://github.com/BDO-Science/contour-zone-of-influence).

Input files are generated using external scripts:

1) Proportion overlap analysis (TODO insert link): generates `data_raw/zoi` files required for contour mapping and the channel length plots.
- Requires h5 file of the alternative of interest and the h5 files without pumping for the same alternative

2) KDE (TODO insert link): generates KDE plots required for Appendix I.
- Requires DSS files

Recommendations for improved documentation:
- Create a generate Appendix I plots and tables script that sources the neccessary scripts in the appropriate order.
- Include better documentation about how to generate input files.
- Clean up the scripts to only include Appendix I output

```{r, include = F}
library(tidyverse)

## Figure I.3-1

This figure will not change

Figure I.3-1. Sum of channel lengths connecting DSM2 nodes with 70% overlap binned by month and different OMR flows. 

## Table I.3-1

This table will not change (based on NAA)

Table I.3-1. December – June ZOI flow groups based on Calsim 3 Sacramento (Freeport) and San Joaquin (Vernalis) River inflows under the No Action Alternative (NAA). Values have been rounded to the nearest integer. 

## Table I.3-2

*Status: Complete*

*source: calculate_frequency_bins_alt5.R*

Table I.3-2b. Sample sizes (months) of Action 5 and the no action alternative (NAA) in each inflow group based on Calsim 3 and DSM2 results. Values have not been filtered for OMR group. 

```{r, echo = F, message = F, warning = F}
table <- read_csv("data_export/tab2_samplesizes_inflowgroups_alts_dsm2_alt5.csv")
knitr::kable(table)
```

## Table I.3-3

This table will not change (based on NAA)

Table I.3-3. Summary Statistics for Inflow Groups and OMR Bins used in Analyses. Cells populated with “NA” indicate a lack of data falling within the specific inflow-OMR grouping. Mean OMR and Mean Exports are associated with the No Action Alternative (NAA). 

## Table 1.3-4

*Status: Complete*

*source: calculate_frequency_bins_alt5.R*

Table I.3-4b. Sample sizes (months) of Action 5 and the no action alternative (NAA) in each inflow group and OMR bin based on Calsim 3 and DSM2 results.

Figure I.3-2b. Sample sizes (months) of Action 5 and the no action alternative (NAA) in each inflow group and OMR bin based on Calsim 3 and DSM2 results. Text denotes sample size in each group. NA indicates values do not fall into pre-designated OMR bin or inflow group. 

## Table I.3-5 

*Status: Missing*

This table should be updated with values for Act5. I don't think we have everything needed for this as we only have NA for those outside of OMR bins and aren't able to break into greater than -1500 and other. Closest script is in `calculate_frequency_bins.R`

Table I.3-5. Proportion of dataset excluded from analysis based on Calsim 3 output under the No Action Alternative (NAA). OMR values in the “Other” bin fall between 2500 to -3000 and -4000 to -4500 cfs. 

## Figure I.3-3

This figure will not change (based on NAA)

Figure I.3-3. Data categorized into Sacramento and San Joaquin River Inflow Groupings. Gray points represent all data. Points outlined in color indicate data points falling within OMR groupings, and used in subsequent modeling. Inset plot zooms in on lower inflow values for greater resolution. Points and inflow grouping are based Calsim 3 results from the No Action Alternative (NAA). 

## Table I.3-6

This table will not change

## Figure I.3-4, I.3-5, I.3-6, I.3-7,

## Figure I.3-8:I.3-103

*Status: Code review in progress, Final results blocked*

*source: KDE python scripts, insert github when available*

These are the KDE v velocity (fps) distribution plots. We will need 12 new plots
for Act5. These are generated in Python scripts that Emanuel is working through.
Waiting on the h5 file for Act5 without pumping.

## Table I.3-7

*Status: Missing*

Need to find where this is generated. I think this must be generated with the KDE plots. Proportion overlap output used in these scripts is by inflow group (the table is only by OMR bin) and channel so there are multiple rows per node whereas the table is by node and OMR.

Table I.3-7b. Proportional overlap values for Turner Cut, SJR at Jersey Point, and Old R at Middle River at different OMR bins across alternatives. 

## Figure I.3-104:111

*Status: Complete*

*source: contour_maps_inflow_alt5.R*

These figures will not change though we will need to add a new one for Act5

These are generated in contour_maps_inflow_Act5.R. We are able to produce these
with a random dummy dataset. We are waiting on the h5 file for Act5_NP to run
the proportional overlap scripts.
