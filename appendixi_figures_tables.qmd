title: "Appendix 1 Figures/Tables"

FlowWest was tasked with generating updated figures and tables for [Appendix I](https://www.usbr.gov/mp/nepa/includes/documentShow.php?Doc_ID=55301). The updated figures/tables
will only include the new Alt5 and NAA (no action alternative). NAA has not changed
since the last version of Appendix I (from Adam Witt) so the results for that scenario
will be the same. 

This document compiles the figures/tables using code originally developed by [Catarina Pien](https://github.com/BDO-Science/contour-zone-of-influence).

```{r, include = F}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Figure I.3-1

This figure will not change

Figure I.3-1. Sum of channel lengths connecting DSM2 nodes with 70% overlap binned by month and different OMR flows. 

## Table I.3-1

This table will not change (based on NAA)

Table I.3-1. December – June ZOI flow groups based on Calsim 3 Sacramento (Freeport) and San Joaquin (Vernalis) River inflows under the No Action Alternative (NAA). Values have been rounded to the nearest integer. 

## Table I.3-2

Table I.3-2b. Sample sizes (months) of alternative 5 and the no action alternative (NAA) in each inflow group based on Calsim 3 and DSM2 results. Values have not been filtered for OMR group. 

```{r, echo = F, message = F, warning = F}
table <- read_csv("data_export/tab2_samplesizes_inflowgroups_alts_dsm2_alt5.csv")
knitr::kable(table)
```

## Table I.3-3

This table will not change (based on NAA)

Table I.3-3. Summary Statistics for Inflow Groups and OMR Bins used in Analyses. Cells populated with “NA” indicate a lack of data falling within the specific inflow-OMR grouping. Mean OMR and Mean Exports are associated with the No Action Alternative (NAA). 

## Table 1.3-4

Table I.3-4b. Sample sizes (months) of alternative 5 and the no action alternative (NAA) in each inflow group and OMR bin based on Calsim 3 and DSM2 results. 

```{r, echo = F, message = F, warning = F}
table <- read_csv("data_export/tab4_samplesizes_inflowgroups_omr_alts_dsm2_alt5.csv")
knitr::kable(table)
```

## Figure 1.3-2

![Figure1.3-2b](figures/plot_dsm2_samples_omr_inflow_blue_alt5.png)

Figure I.3-2b. Sample sizes (months) of alternative 5 and the no action alternative (NAA) in each inflow group and OMR bin based on Calsim 3 and DSM2 results. Text denotes sample size in each group. NA indicates values do not fall into pre-designated OMR bin or inflow group. 

## Table I.3-5 

TODO

We should have values for Alt5. I don't think we have everything needed for this as we only have NA for those
outside of bins and aren't able to break into greater than -1500 and other. Closest script is in calculate_frequency_bins.R

Table I.3-5. Proportion of dataset excluded from analysis based on Calsim 3 output under the No Action Alternative (NAA). OMR values in the “Other” bin fall between 2500 to -3000 and -4000 to -4500 cfs. 

## Figure I.3-3

This figure will not change (based on NAA)

Figure I.3-3. Data categorized into Sacramento and San Joaquin River Inflow Groupings. Gray points represent all data. Points outlined in color indicate data points falling within OMR groupings, and used in subsequent modeling. Inset plot zooms in on lower inflow values for greater resolution. Points and inflow grouping are based Calsim 3 results from the No Action Alternative (NAA). 

## Table I.3-6

This table will not change

## Figure I.3-4, I.3-5, I.3-6, I.3-7, 

These figures will not change

## Figure I.3-8:I.3-103

## Table I.3-7

TODO find where this is generated

Table I.3-7b. Proportional overlap values for Turner Cut, SJR at Jersey Point, and Old R at Middle River at different OMR bins across alternatives. 

## Figure I.3-104:111

These figures will not change. We will need to add a new one for Alt5

These are generated in contour_maps_inflow_alt5.R. We are able to produce these
but something is going with the data and nothing is showing up in the map. This
is due to the dummy data with overlap is 100%. Tried with a random set of data and
also get a weird plot. Confirm this is working as expected.

The data used to generate these are fake - randomly generated.
